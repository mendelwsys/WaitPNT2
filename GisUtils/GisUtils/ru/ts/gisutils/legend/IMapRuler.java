/**
 * Ruler is part of a map legend, showing length of the standard unit on the
 * map.
 * 
 * <pre>
 * The ruler itself is drawn from 20 smaller rectangles (cells) in width 
 * and 2 in height:
 * 
 * 0|                        NNN  km   |
 *  |------.------.------.------.------|------.---
 *  |BBBBBB|      |BBBBBB|      |BBBBBB|      |BBBBBB|
 *  |------|------|------|------|------|------|------|--
 *  |      |BBBBBB|      |BBBBBB|      |BBBBBB|      |BBBBBB
 *  |------.------.------.------.------.------.------.-----
 *  
 *  where rectangles with BBBBBB are black and with spaces are white
 *  Each small rectangle is a so called &quot;cell&quot;. 5x2 block 
 *  of cells forms so called &quot;segment&quot;. 4 in width segments forms the ruler itself.
 *  Each segment is separated from follow one with a &quot;touch&quot; 
 *  (straight vertical short lines on the segment right edge). 
 *  Each touch has height of the &quot;ruler unit&quot;.
